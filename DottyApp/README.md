# Software Project: Dotty App

## Introduction
This was an example project from my Mobile App Development class. I recreated the app using Android Studio.

## Details
The Dotty App is based on the popular Dots app by Playdots, Inc. This app uses a custom view and animations.
The user must connect similarly colored dots that are adjacent to each other to score points. The more dots that are
connected, the more points awarded. Connected dots disappear and are replaced with dots from above.
