# Software Project: Timer App

## Introduction
This was an example project from my Mobile App Development class. I recreated the app using Android Studio.

## Details
The Timer app allows a user to create a countdown timer. The app uses a Handler and Runnable to create
a timer that can be started, paused, resumed, and cancelled.
