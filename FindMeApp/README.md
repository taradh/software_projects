# Software Project: Find Me App

## Introduction 
This was an example project from my Mobile App Development class. I recreated the app using Android Studio.

## Details
The Find Me App uses the fused location provider and the Maps SDK for Android to show a user's location on a map.
I thoroughly enjoyed recreating this app because I'm a big fan of Google maps and this was the first time I used it.
